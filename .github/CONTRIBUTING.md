# Contributing to this project

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What kinds of contributions we are looking for

TechnicalReport is an open source project and we would love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

# Ground Rules

## Responsibilities
* Be respectful!
* Search for issus before opening a new one. Someone might have already thought about what you want to do.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through the [Help Wanted issues](https://github.com/73VW/TechnicalReport/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted").

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can read: [Make a pull request](http://makeapullrequest.com/) and [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

If you don't know how to do it, read [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) first and ask for help from the community by pinging team members in your PR for example.

# Getting started

## Before you submit changes:

If you don't want to make changes that wouldn't be accepted, read the following.

1. Open an issue and describe completely your idea.
2. Discuss about it whith the community.

## If your idea has been accepted and you want to submit changes to anything:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change:
    * Be sure you have run the test script in the root directory.
    * Fix the eventual bugs reported by the script.
    * Send a pull request and fill the template **completely**.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors can be submitted through an issue.
The changes will be made by the owners.


# How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What did you do?
2. What did you expect to see?
3. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in TechnicalReport, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs.
Go through the issues first and if you don't find what you need, then open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

We will review all pull requests.
Thereby this might take time.

Thank you for reading this file!
